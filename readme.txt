1. The pdf document state every thing in a well-organised way and it contains all the tables, pictures and comments on them, 
read it and you can know everything I do.üòÉ‚úåÔ∏è

2. 'XHY_exercise_climate.m' is the main matlab script. 'aggregation.m', 'get_annual_max.m' and 'IDF.m' are self-made functions. 
'IDF.m' contains 4 analytical formular and you can check their expressions, their parameters, their fitting quality in excel file.

3.'gevfit.png' shows the result of GEV analysis on aggregation data, because I use D from 1 to 24, there are 24 figures correspond
to each D. 'IDF_curve.png' shows the final result and there are many information including analytical formula expression and RMSE
and R-square. 'Timeseries_negative.png' and 'timeseries_positive.png' show the timeseries of raw data and data without negative
values.

This is a climate-class exercise.
